Sailsd
======

Build status: [![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/sails-simulator/sailsd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sails-simulator/sailsd)

Sailsd is a simple daemon which simulates a small sailing boat in real time
using [libsailing](https://github.com/sails-simulator/libsailing).
Information about the boat's current sensor readings (position, heading and
wind conditions), and commands to move the rudder and sails can be accessed
over a socket.

The intended purpose of sailsd is to be a component of a testing framework for
evaluating the behaviour of autonomous sailing boats.

Protocol
--------

Sailsd uses a simple protocol consisting of JSON message sent over TCP on port
3333.

Current values can be requested with `"request"`:

```json
{"request": ["version"]}
```

```json
{"request": ["latitude", "longitude"]}
```

Another JSON message is returned, which contains an object containing the
requested attributes.
This can be quickly tested using netcat:

```bash
$ echo '{"request": ["heading"]}' | nc localhost 3333
{"heading": 0.36001499947321913}
```

Values can be set using `"set"`:

```json
{"set": {"rudder": 0}}
```

```json
{"set": {"rudder": 0, "sail": 10}}
```

```json
{"set": {"latitude": 0, "longitude": 0}}
```

Setting and requesting can be combined in the same message, for example:

```json
{"set": {"rudder-angle": 0.2}, "request": ["heading", "rudder-angle"]}
```

Available values:

- `version`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `sail-angle`
- `heading`
- `rudder-angle`
- `wind-speed`
- `wind-angle`
- `speed`
- `sheet-length`


Installing locally
------------------

Make sure `libsailing` is installed by cloning this repository with

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/sails-simulator/sailsd.git

Install dependencies (jansson for JSON parsing):

### MacOS

    $ xcode-select --install
    $ brew install jansson

### Debian and ubuntu

    $ sudo apt install libjansson-dev

### Fedora and other red hat distros

    $ sudo dnf install jansson-devel

### NixOS

    $ nix-shell --pure -p pkgconfig jansson

Then compile using make:

    $ make

Alternatively, install Nix and run

    $ nix-env -i sailsd

Build and run with Docker
------------------------------

    $ docker build -t quay.io/sails/sailsd .
    $ docker run -p 3333:3333 quay.io/sails/sailsd
    $ echo '{"request": ["version"]}' | nc localhost 3333
      {"version": "1.0"}

Code styling
------------

Sailsd uses astyle to automate style conformity. Run:

    $ astyle --style=linux --indent=tab *.c
